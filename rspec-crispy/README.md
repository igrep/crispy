## Contributing

1. Fork it ( https://github.com/igrep/rspec-crispy/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request

### NOTE

- You must use `rake test` to run `rspec spec/rspec/crispy/configure_without_conflict_spec.rb` and `rspec spec/rspec/crispy/mock_with_rspec_crispy_spec.rb` separately. Do NOT run all specs at once by `rspec spec`.  
- Set `1` to `USE_CRISPY_IN_THIS_REPOSITORY` environment variable if you want to test rspec-crispy with the crispy in this repository instead of the crispy released on rubygems.org.
